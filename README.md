# RecursiveAlgTimer
This program counts down as a timer. It uses a recursive algorithm instead of using a loop.
It uses the decremented number as an actual parameter for the method call of countDown() until the method reaches its base case, which is 1.

Precondition: The inserted value must be a positive integer.
Postcondition: The timer counts down to 1. Then, the program prints out Down!

If the inserted value is floating-point or negative, the program will print out only Done.
